# About

The aim of this project is to develop a security and reliable system that is capable of surveilling a determined perimeter and detecting potential trespassers. To achieve this goal we will provide the enterprises with a user-friendly API that enables them to customize and monitor every aspect of the system. Furthermore, we will provide our very own autonomous robot for this precise task.

## Introduction

Surveillance is key to ensuring the integrity and safety of any facility, but it is very costly and not always effective when performed by humans. There are many factors that contribute to this issue, such as the unwillingness to work at certain time frames (night shift, for example) or the vast size of some properties. Consequently, due to the emergence of solid machine learning models and efficient autonomous robots and UAVs, a new security standard was born.

While autonomous vehicles have become integral to surveillance in recent years, there are still areas where they lack capability. However, we cannot improve most of the technical facets due to their complicated nature. Therefore, the aim of this project will be to improve the development and management of these robots.

The development of the project will be within the context of ``Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya`` (UPC), Informatics Engineering Bachelor's Degree. It belongs to the ``Information Technologies Project`` (PTI) subject and ``Information Technologies`` (IT) major.

## Description

This project, named after the mythological automaton giant Talos, who was in charge of protecting Europa and surveilling the coast of Crete, comprises two main components that must be implemented: autonomous robots and a user-friendly interface that manages and monitors them. First, let us examine the requirements and specifications of the robot before proceeding to the development of the user interface (UI).

The autonomous vehicle will be a four-wheeled car due to its simplicity, easy implementation and the amount of space it provides to securely place the hardware. Nonetheless, we explored alternatives such as a UAV, but it would over-complicate the project and make it more costly. Its main capabilities include video recording, sensor monitoring and autonomous driving.

Although the hardware is primordial to the project, we will put the most emphasis on the UI development and its available tools, as they are what links the project to the ``Information Technologies`` subject and the major it belongs to. Hence, we will provide two APIs, a hosted website and an application. 

Last but not least, interconnecting the interfaces with the hardware and providing a database to store all the information is paramount to make the system work. 

## Justification

The PTI subject is fundamental in the culmination of specialized studies, as it encompasses the multifaceted perspective an engineer must possess. It requires them to develop a multidisciplinary project that incorporates the use of various technologies. Hence, this project must fulfill this requirement, integrate multiple technologies in order to craft a meaningful implementation.

This proposal includes website, backend, application and hardware development. Moreover, interconnecting these elements and providing functionalities will involve the use of build-automation, Dockerization, monitoring tools, artificial intelligence (AI) and others. In other words, the development of this project requires a firm understanding of diverse fields and successful integration of them. Furthermore, it fills the aforementioned gap in the market about surveillance providers, which mentioned the lack of user-friendly interfaces to easily setup and monitor a perimeter.

## Innovation potential

As discussed previously, the concept of offering an interface that significantly simplifies the utilization of monitoring tools and devices is currently nonexistent. While there are some existing tools available, none of them encompass the functionalities of autonomous robots, such as configuring robots, video streaming, and alert modes. Therefore, continuing this project could substantially enhance not only the deployment process but also the overall security. 

Furthermore, if some additional functionalities were to be implemented, such as a trained machine learning model for detecting intruders or a more cost and energy efficient robot, it could shape the industry. All in all, it is the next step for improving surveillance performance and making these technologies more available to the public. To clarify, these systems are not so available to the public, they are costly and very hard to setup.

## Environmental Factors

In order to survey large perimeters there is a widespread tendency of hiring agents that patrol around it with some sort of non-environmentally friendly vehicle. Hence, reducing the need for the use of these by offering an alternative would reduce CO2 emissions. By making use of electrically-powered drones or cars there is no need to worry about greenhouse gases.
