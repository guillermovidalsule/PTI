# Get Started

The purpose of this document is to offer comprehensive guidance on the project at hand. It will illustrate the procedures for configuring and enhancing functionalities within our surveillance system. For those unfamiliar with the project, please consult the "[About](./about_us.md)" section.

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our innovative surveillance robot project. This project blends advanced technology with real-world utility to develop a flexible and effective solution for surveillance needs.

As the heart of our surveillance robot we have the powerful Lichee Pi A4, a compact yet robust single-board computer capable of handling complex tasks with ease. By teaming up with the Arduino Uno microcontroller, our system has the advantages of both platforms, ensuring smooth integration and optimal performance.

The communication beetween both single-board computers occurs thorugh a UART (`Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter`) connection, enabling rapid data exchange and real-time control of the robot's functionalities. To get more in depth with the hardware, consult the [Hardware](./hardware.md) section.

Throughout this documentation, we will explore the details of our surveillance robot, covering aspects such as software setup, software implementation, and operational procedures. Whether or not you are familiar with IT, this documentation aims to provide comprehensive guidance to help you understand, build, and utilize our brand new product.

Let's explore all the capabilities and potential of this surveillance robot project.
